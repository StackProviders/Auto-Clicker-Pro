## üìã How to Use

### 1. Adding a Step

This is the core of the extension. To record a click position:

1.  Go to any webpage.
2.  **Right-click** on the exact spot you want the automated click to happen.
3.  In the context menu that appears, navigate to **üöÄ Auto Clicker Pro ‚Üí ‚ûï Add Click Step**.
4.  The step will be automatically saved to your sequence. You can see it by opening the extension popup.

### 2. Starting and Stopping the Sequence

-   **To Start:** Open the extension popup and click the green **"Start Sequence"** button. The sequence will begin executing on the current active tab.
-   **To Stop:** While the sequence is running, the button will turn into a red **"Stop Execution"** button. Click it at any time to immediately stop the process.

### 3. Configuring Loops

Before starting the sequence, you can set up looping for repetitive tasks:

1.  Check the **"Enable Looping"** box.
2.  **For a finite loop:** Enter the desired number of repetitions in the **"Loop Count"** field.
3.  **For an infinite loop:** Simply check the **"Infinite Loop"** box. This will override the loop count.

### 4. Managing Individual Steps

Each recorded step in the popup has two action buttons:

-   **‚úèÔ∏è Edit:** Click this to open a modal window where you can change the **delay (in milliseconds)** that occurs _before_ this step is executed.
-   **üóëÔ∏è Delete:** Click this to permanently remove the step from your sequence.

### 5. Clearing All Steps

If you want to start fresh, click the **"Clear All"** button at the top of the steps list. A confirmation prompt will appear to prevent accidental deletion.
